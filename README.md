# Data-Visualization-Project

This project aims to analyze a comprehensive health dataset for 2023, examining mortality rates in diverse states and counties in the United States. Leveraging advanced data visualization tools like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Holoview, etc, we seek to identify trends in death rates and factors contributing to those deaths. The goal is to elucidate patterns that highlight areas lacking sufficient healthcare facilities, aiding policymakers in directing resources for targeted interventions. This project aims to contribute to evidence-based decision-making for improved public health outcomes.

Our goal is to pay larger emphasis on the availability of medical care facilities in different regions. This information will serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, assisting them in directing resources to areas in urgent need of enhanced medical services. The ultimate goal is to facilitate evidence-based decision-making and contribute to targeted interventions aimed at improving public health outcomes.
