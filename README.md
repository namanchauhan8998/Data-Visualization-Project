# Data-Visualization-Project
This project aims to analyze a comprehensive health dataset for 2023, examining mortality rates in diverse states and counties in the United States. Leveraging advanced data visualization tools like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Holoview, etc, we seek to identify trends in death rates and factors contributing to those deaths.
